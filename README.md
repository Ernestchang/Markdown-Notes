Android app to edit, create and view markdown files

# Warning: This app is using a javascript markdown-parser, which opens the app to XSS-vulnerabilities for script in the markdown files. This applies, due to the current implementation, also to directories you browse, without explicitly open a file.

I made this app, because I found no app first using a monospaced font for editing, and second allowing to edit files.
So as this app is made to exceed other apps, where they are laking features, I am very open to implement features, someone requests.

Also as I am primarily a developer, this app clearly is laking in design and intuitive use.
I am very appreciate about any suggestions in this direction.
Also there is no icon at the moment.

A big problem other markdown apps also have, is that there isn't a real good compatible java markdown library.
If someone knows one, or is developing at one, I would provide this app as an (early) implementation.
